As someone who has worked remotely a lot of my career, let me offer this #protip.

## Who, who, who, who?

Whatever tools you use to communicate via the interweb, make sure your profile provides enough info about yourself so others have that context.

If you are in an organization with more then a few dozen folks, this should include your real name, your _relative_ job title[^1], and the group you work in.

Bonus points will be awarded for pronouns and name pronunciations. 

Unless everyone is physically located in the same timezone, include that too. Some tools make it simple to show everyone's local time, which is how it shoudl be.

And for the love of Pete, don't use any acronyms. Ever.

## I really want to know

And if you are the type to use GitHub, add your real name to your profile. Trying to remember everyone's <del>CB radio handle</del> username is an annoying pain in the butt. 

Empathy is a common trait of the best developers.

[^1]: Just enough to understand what you do. I don't care what your formal level is; your official royal lineage; or whether you are senior, junior, or infantile. Adding that is just tacky.
