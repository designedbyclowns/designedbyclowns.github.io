It took me about three months, but yesterday I slid it into place in the corner of my garage where it will probably stay until the house falls into the sea.

## Why

I've always been drawn to the idea of working with hand tools. I went through a phase in the early 90's of regularly watching [The Woodright's Shop](https://www.pbs.org/show/woodwrights-shop/), but that was in the heyday of my bohemian phase and I didn't have enough nickels to rub together – wooden or otherwise – to afford the tools. Let alone a space to use them, or for that matter, wood.

The mystical world of chisels and hand planes would remain out of reach for a long while. Sharpening a forbidden black art.

Fast forward a handful of decades, and after moving to the area last year, I discovered the nearby [Port Townsend School of Woodworking](https://www.ptwoodschool.org/our-story). So I took a series  introductory weekend classes.

Now I've established a beach head in a corner of the garage (negotiations are ongoing), read and watched way more on the subject than anyone should, and joined the other regular interlopers at [Edendsaw woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MtSYeiJ0Vc&t=60s) like some kind of petting zoo.

It turns our [Roy Underhill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au1TbIyLcPU) was just the gateway drug. You've been warned.

Oh and I have a [guy](https://www.antique-used-tools.com/bob_who.htm). A dealer that swings by the house every few weeks in an old van - though significantly younger then he is – loaded with vintage tools. I'm such a loyal customer that he comes here first, before he visits the [wooden boatbuilding school](https://nwswb.edu), boat yards and other woodworkers in the area. And those are the _pros_.

I should probably start going to meetings.

So, I needed a workbench. And of course not just any bench, but a _proper_ woodworking bench.

Tradition demands you build it yourself.

## What

The next question of course is which bench. This leads down more than a few rabbit holes. 

For me the choice quickly boiled down to these three forms, Moravian, Nickelson, or Roubo.

### Moravian

The [Moravian Workbench ](https://woodandshop.com/moravian-workbench-tour/) is a beautiful bench. And the utility of how easily it breaks down and goes back together, all without relying on mechanical fasteners is amazing. Its just a wonderful design to my eye. 

I watched the entire [seven hour series](https://store.woodandshop.com/products/digital-download-building-the-portable-moravian-workbench-with-will-myers) on building this bench, a few times. It was worth every minute. [Will Myers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKPpp5_bbE) walks you through the build process in clear, approachable manner. Or maybe that his soft spoken southern drawl. 

Its hard to resist.

In the end I decided this might be a tad too much for me to take on the first time out. I had visions of redoing the legs one too many times as I screwed up the various joints. Also, for the first time in my life I have room for a bench to hang around a while, so the portability is not much of an advantage. But I'll call you next time I'm back in I-need-a-worbench town, so don't forget me.

### Nicholson

The Nicholson workbench, A.K.A. an English Joiner's bench.  I _think_ its probably the easiest to build of these three? But I really don't know.

Instinctively I'd rather have a thick, solid top. And the apron seems problematic in today's world of affordable clamps. 

Like it, don't love it.

###  Roubo

Eventually all this spelunking leads to [Christopher Schwarz](https://christophermschwarz.com/about), the chief denizen of the warren, and [The Anarchist's Workbench](https://lostartpress.com/collections/workbenches/products/the-anarchists-workbench).

The book is full of nerdy historical context, and deliberate rebellion, as our protagonist eventually arrives at a very prgamatic interpretation of this 18th century French classic. Its a fun read. The [PDF](https://blog.lostartpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AWB_Consumer_June-2020_v5.1-1.pdf) is free, so have a go yourself.

It includes just the right amount of instruction for this simplified version. The whole thing is intended to be built from readily available framing lumber, making it relatively affordable, but is still assembled without the use of mechanical fasteners, thereby preserving ones own hubris.

Its a very buildable bench. And with a 5" thick top and 5" square legs, its built like a tank.

So yes, this is the one for me. Though I may occasionally steal a glance in Moravian's direction.

## How

It starts with 2" x 12" framing lumber. In my corner of the world that means Douglas Fir. About $500 worth. Luckily just across town, which mean past the one 4 way stop and out to the highway there's a [good lumber yard](https://www.carlsbuildingsupply.com) that has plenty of quality kiln dried select #1. No schlepping though the usual big box store crap for this cowboy. And for that price, you get free delivery.
