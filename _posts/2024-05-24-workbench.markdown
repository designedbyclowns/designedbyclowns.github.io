It took me about three months, but yesterday I slid it into place in the corner of my garage where it will probably stay until the house falls into the sea.

## Why

I've always been drawn to the idea of working with hand tools. I went through a phase in the early 90's of regularly watching [The Woodright's Shop](https://www.pbs.org/show/woodwrights-shop/), but that was in the heart of my bohemian days and I didn't have enough nickels to rub together – wooden or otherwise – to afford the tools. Let alone a space to use them, or for that matter, wood.

The mystical world of chisels and hand planes would remain out of reach for a long while. Sharpening a forbidden black art.

Fast forward a handful of decades, and after moving to the area last year, I discovered the nearby [Port Townsend School of Woodworking](https://www.ptwoodschool.org/our-story). So I took a series  introductory weekend classes.

Now I've established a beachhead in a corner of the garage (negotiations are ongoing), read and watched way more on the subject than anyone should, and joined the other regular interlopers at [Edendsaw woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MtSYeiJ0Vc&t=60s) like some kind of petting zoo.

 It turns our [Roy Underhill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au1TbIyLcPU) was just the gateway drug. You've been warned.

Oh and I have a [guy](https://www.antique-used-tools.com/bob_who.htm). A dealer that swings by the house every few weeks in an old van - though significantly younger then he is – loaded with vintage tools. I'm such a good customer that he comes here first, before he visits the [wooden boatbuilding school](https://nwswb.edu), boat yards and other woodworkers in the area. And those are the _pros_.

I should probably start going to meetings.

So, I needed a workbench. And of course not just any bench, but a _proper_ woodworking bench.

Tradition demands you build it yourself.
